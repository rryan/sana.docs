\section{Client User Guide: Small Scale Clinic}
Targeted at small groups (10-15) of clinicians and administrators, who want to setup a local installation of Sana. If your clinic or healthcare facility is small, and you want to use Sana to track routine changes or occurances in your paitent population (usually fewer than 100 patients), this is your guide.
